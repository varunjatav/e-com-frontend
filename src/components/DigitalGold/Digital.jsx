                            Digital Gold is an organised and transparent method of buying 24-carat gold in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
                            Digital Gold is neither a financial product nor a deposit but a method of purchasing gold for your personal needs.
                            Digital Gold gives the flexibility for customers to accumulate gold in any denomination, say as low as Rs. 10.
                            Physical gold will be bought by service providers and stored in very safe vaults for the customer. Customers need not go through the hassle of storing and securing the gold.
                            At the same time, customers have the flexibility to sell the gold at any time, convert to physical gold and ask for delivery or exchange digital gold for physical jewellery at a Tanishq/CaratLane website or store.

                            Tanishq Digital Gold is in bullion form and is safely stored in a central vault.
                            There is no movement for this gold. But for jewellery the gold has to travel between multiple entities to get the product manufactured.
                            The logistics costs incurred by the jewellery gold are substantially different from the gold stored in the central vault. Hence, the jewellery gold rate will always be higher than the digital gold.

                            When you ask for delivery, the requisite quantity of gold will be removed from the Custodian and delivered to you through a reputed courier service.
                            Since the Security Trustee has a charge over the gold, any unlikely adverse event happening to the company will not affect the gold associated with the accumulations in your account.
                            Further, the title of the gold clearly rests with you and the physical gold stored with the Custodian on account of SafeGold customers is not an asset of SafeGold in any way.

                            Digital Gold is an organised and transparent method of buying 24-carat gold in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
                            Digital Gold is neither a financial product nor a deposit but a method of purchasing gold for your personal needs.
                            Digital Gold gives the flexibility for customers to accumulate gold in any denomination, say as low as Rs. 10.
                            Physical gold will be bought by service providers and stored in very safe vaults for the customer. Customers need not go through the hassle of storing and securing the gold.
                            At the same time, customers have the flexibility to sell the gold at any time, convert to physical gold and ask for delivery or exchange digital gold for physical jewellery at a Tanishq/CaratLane website or store.

                            Tanishq Digital Gold is in bullion form and is safely stored in a central vault.
                            There is no movement for this gold. But for jewellery the gold has to travel between multiple entities to get the product manufactured.
                            The logistics costs incurred by the jewellery gold are substantially different from the gold stored in the central vault. Hence, the jewellery gold rate will always be higher than the digital gold.

                            Yes. The gold purchased on your behalf is stored with Brink's, the leading safe keeper of precious metals across the world.
                            The gold is insured, both for storage and transit when being delivered to you. Further, IDBI Trusteeship has a charge on all gold stored in the vault in your favour.
                            This ensures that your gold is protected at all times regardless of any external events.

                            The gold associated with the accumulations in your account is separate from the other assets of the SafeGold.
                            IDBI Trusteeship Services Limited, an independent trustee, acts for and on your behalf.
                            The gold purchased by the Company associated with the accumulations in your accounts is held with the Custodian.
                            When you ask for delivery, the requisite quantity of gold will be removed from the Custodian and delivered to you through a reputed courier service.
                            Since the Security Trustee has a charge over the gold, any unlikely adverse event happening to the company will not affect the gold associated with the accumulations in your account.
                            Further, the title of the gold clearly rests with you and the physical gold stored with the Custodian on account of SafeGold customers is not an asset of SafeGold in any way.

Tanishq Digital Gold provides a live sell price.
You can choose to sell any amount starting with a minimum of Rs. 10 to a maximum of the amount of gold that you own.
You can choose the bank account (previously saved) or enter a new bank account to get the money.
The money will be credited to your bank account.
For security reasons, newly added bank accounts will be verified by doing a penny drop bank verification—i.e., a small amount will be credited to your bank account for verification purposes.
